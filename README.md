# ansible_module_gitlabci_runner
ansible module to register gitlabci-runner easier and idempotently  

For the moment only support docker executor (and not all options)

_note than i'm not fluent in python, and this is my first attempt to create ansible module (just finished to read tutorial). Feel free to propose fix, optimisation, better code if you see noob code_
